## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Tried to add a fluid layout

**Note:**

### What I learned
This is my first challenge attempt and I can say it helped me understand a few things about flexbox, though I won't say I know all the ins and outs now. But It's a start and More challenges to be taken up. 

### Continued development
In future challenges I want to focus more on understanding different ways to design mobile responsive and fluid designs. That's what I would be focusing on. 

### Useful resources

- [ColorHunt](https://colorhunt.co/palettes/fall) - This helped me to look for various color pallete, it is definitely a great help in designing process.

Thank you!
